The Mariana Trench or Marianas Trench is the deepest part of the worlds oceans. It is located in the western Pacific Ocean, an average of 200 kilometres 124 mi to the east of the Mariana Islands, in the Western Pacific East of Philippines. It is a crescentshaped scar in the Earths crust, and measures about 2,550 km 1,580 mi long and 69 km 43 mi wide on average. It reaches a maximumknown depth of 10,994 metres 36,070 ft  40 metres 130 ft at a small slotshaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep, at its southern end, although some unrepeated measurements place the deepest portion at 11,034 metres 36,201 ft. For comparison: if Mount Everest were dropped into the trench at this point, its peak would still be over 1.6 kilometres 1 mi underwater. In 2009, Marianas Trench was established as a United States National Monument.
